This repository contains the compilation of all projects, majority university assignments and some personal side projects. Compilations are required for some languages.

- COMP10120 :
First year group project, which involves PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL. My main task in this project is to lead the front end team,in designing the interface using the Bootstrap framework.

- COMP15111 :
The folder contains some basic Assembly code, mainly focusing on ARM Assembly, building on the foundation for computer architecture course. Problems involving branching, method, stack and register selection. Assembler used was Bennett.

- COMP16321 :
Basic introduction to Python.

- COMP16412 :
Basic introduction to Java. Main focus on these folders (Chess and MagicBakery) are to create corresponding games with Java language, with heavy emphasis on OOP. 

- COMP12111 :
This course unit mainly focused on hardware design, specifically on CPU. This is the first introduction to Hardware Description Language, and MU0 was designed by using asynchronous and synchronous logic using Verilog and synthesised on an FPGA after a set of simulation.

- COMP15212 :
Basic on computer organisation, and interaction between hardware and software. This course unit mainly focused in that small layer between hardware and user-facing software by discussing the way Operating System manages memory and optimisation in computer hardware. COursework is on different caching strategy, written in Python.

- COMP13212 :
Data science introduces basic for classical statistics and Bayesian statictics. Assignments focus on data visualisastion, graphic, and producing a machine learning model by constructing a spam filter without use of external library other than graphing. Mainly written in Python.
=======
This repository includes all my work throughout my exciting first year in University of Manchester !

Languages included :
1. Programming 1 - Python
2. Programming 2 - Java
3. Engineering - Verilog (CPU design)
4. Architecture - ARM Assembly
5. Data Science - Python (Basic visualisation and hypothesis testing, Naive Bayes Classification)
6. Group Project - PHP, HTML, Javascript, CSS, Python (Web development)
7. Operating System - Python (Caching algorithm)

Note that this does not include all modules done in the first year, as some modules are not related to programming.
